acceptedNameUsage description,"The full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known, of the accepted (botanical) or valid (zoological) name in cases where the provided scientificName is considered by the reference indicated in the accordingTo property, or of the content provider, to be a synonym or misapplied name. When applied to an Organism or Occurrence, this term should be used in cases where a content provider regards the provided scientificName to be inconsistent with the taxonomic perspective of the content provider. For example, there are many discrepancies within specimen collections and observation datasets between the recorded name (e.g., the most recent identification from an expert who examined a specimen, or a field identification for an observed organism), and the name asserted by the content provider to be taxonomically accepted."
acceptedNameUsageID description,This term should be used for synonyms or misapplied names to refer to the taxonID of a Taxon record that represents the accepted (botanical) or valid (zoological) name. For Darwin Core Archives the related record should be present locally in the same archive.

nameAccordingTo description,"This term provides context to the `scientificName`.

When not provided, in Taxon Core data sets the `nameAccordingTo` can be taken to be the data set. In this case the data set mostly provides sufficient context to infer the delimitation of the taxon and its relationship with other taxa. In Occurrence Core data sets, when not provided, `nameAccordingTo` can be an underlying taxonomy of the data set, e.g. Plants of the World Online (http://powo.science.kew.org/) for vascular plant records in iNaturalist (in which case it should be provided), or, which is the case for most `PreservedSpecimen` data sets, the `Identification`, in which case there is no further context."
