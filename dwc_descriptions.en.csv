verbatimSRS description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/verbatimSRS,"Recommended best practice is to use the EPSG code of the SRS, if known. Otherwise use a controlled vocabulary for the name or code of the geodetic datum, if known. Otherwise use a controlled vocabulary for the name or code of the ellipsoid, if known. If none of these is known, use the value `unknown`."
waterBody description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/waterBody,Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names.
pathway description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/pathway,"Recommended best practice is to use controlled value strings from the controlled vocabulary designated for use with this term, listed at http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/doc/pw/. For details, refer to https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.38084"
degreeOfEstablishment description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/degreeOfEstablishment,"Recommended best practice is to use controlled value strings from the controlled vocabulary designated for use with this term, listed at http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/doc/doe/. For details, refer to https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.38084"
recordedByID description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/recordedByID,"Recommended best practice is to provide a single identifier that disambiguates the details of the identifying agent. If a list is used, it is recommended to separate the values in the list with space vertical bar space ( | ). The order of the identifiers on any list for this term can not be guaranteed to convey any semantics."
verticalDatum description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/verticalDatum,Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary.
verbatimIdentification description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/verbatimIdentification,"This term is meant to allow the capture of an unaltered original identification/determination, including identification qualifiers, hybrid formulas, uncertainties, etc. This term is meant to be used in addition to `scientificName` (and `identificationQualifier` etc.), not instead of it."
identifiedByID description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/identifiedByID,"Recommended best practice is to provide a single identifier that disambiguates the details of the identifying agent. If a list is used, the order of the identifiers on the list should not be assumed to convey any semantics. Recommended best practice is to separate the values in a list with space vertical bar space ( | )."
genericName description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/genericName,For synonyms the accepted genus and the genus part of the name may be different. The term genericName should be used together with specificEpithet to form a binomial and with infraspecificEpithet to form a trinomial. The term genericName should only be used for combinations. Uninomials of generic rank do not have a genericName.
infragenericEpithet description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/infragenericEpithet,"The term infragenericEpithet should be used in conjunction with genericName, specificEpithet, infraspecificEpithet, taxonRank and scientificNameAuthorship to represent the individual elements of the complete scientificName. It can be used to indicate the subgenus placement of a species, which in zoology is often given in parentheses. Can also be used to share infrageneric names such as botanical sections (e.g., `Vicia sect. Cracca`)."
cultivarEpithet description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/cultivarEpithet,"According to the Rules of the Cultivated Plant Code, a cultivar name consists of a botanical name followed by a cultivar epithet. The value given as the cultivarEpithet should exclude any quotes. The term taxonRank should be used to indicate which type of cultivated plant name (e.g. cultivar, cultivar group, grex) is concerned. This epithet, including any enclosing apostrophes or suffix, should be provided in scientificName as well."
relationshipOfResourceID description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/relationshipOfResourceID,"Recommended best practice is to use the identifiers of the terms in a controlled vocabulary, such as the OBO Relation Ontology."
MaterialCitation description,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/MaterialCitation,"This class constitutes a new value for the controlled vocabulary in the recommendations for basisOfRecord. When importing Darwin Core Archives of literature-based datasets to GBIF, the basisOfRecord should be changed from “Occurrence”, ""PreservedSpecimen"" or ""Literature"" to “MaterialCitation”."
