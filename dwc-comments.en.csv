Rules of priority then are used to define the taxonomic status of the nomenclature contained in that scope, combined with the experts opinion. It must be linked to a specific taxonomic reference that defines the concept."
taxonRank comment,The taxonomic rank of the most specific name in the scientificName.
taxonRemarks comment,Comments or notes about the taxon or name.
typeStatus comment,"A list (concatenated and separated) of nomenclatural types (type status, typified scientific name, publication) applied to the subject."
verbatimCoordinates comment,"The verbatim original spatial coordinates of the Location. The coordinate ellipsoid, geodeticDatum, or full Spatial Reference System (SRS) for these coordinates should be stored in verbatimSRS and the coordinate system should be stored in verbatimCoordinateSystem."
verbatimCoordinateSystem comment,The coordinate format for the verbatimLatitude and verbatimLongitude or the verbatimCoordinates of the Location.
verbatimDepth comment,The original description of the depth below the local surface.
verbatimElevation comment,"The original description of the elevation (altitude, usually above sea level) of the Location."
verbatimEventDate comment,The verbatim original representation of the date and time information for an Event.
verbatimLatitude comment,"The verbatim original latitude of the Location. The coordinate ellipsoid, geodeticDatum, or full Spatial Reference System (SRS) for these coordinates should be stored in verbatimSRS and the coordinate system should be stored in verbatimCoordinateSystem."
verbatimLocality comment,The original textual description of the place.
verbatimLongitude comment,"The verbatim original longitude of the Location. The coordinate ellipsoid, geodeticDatum, or full Spatial Reference System (SRS) for these coordinates should be stored in verbatimSRS and the coordinate system should be stored in verbatimCoordinateSystem."
verbatimScientificNameRank (deprecated) comment,The taxonomic rank of the most specific name in the scientificName as it appears in the original record.
verbatimSRS comment,"The ellipsoid, geodetic datum, or spatial reference system (SRS) upon which coordinates given in verbatimLatitude and verbatimLongitude, or verbatimCoordinates are based."
verbatimTaxonRank comment,The taxonomic rank of the most specific name in the scientificName as it appears in the original record.
vernacularName comment,A common or vernacular name.
waterBody comment,The name of the water body in which the Location occurs.
year comment,"The four-digit year in which the Event occurred, according to the Common Era Calendar."
pathway comment,The process by which an Organism came to be in a given place at a given time.
degreeOfEstablishment comment,"The degree to which an Organism survives, reproduces, and expands its range at the given place and time."
