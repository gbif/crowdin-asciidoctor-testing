== Link test

We can link to <<links,this section>>.

We can also link this way: <<links>>.

We can link to the section on <<Table test,tables>> (or <<Table test>>).  The same for <<blocks,blocks>> (or <<blocks>>).

Finally, to <<paragraphs,paragraphs (no custom id)>> or <<paragraphs>>.

=== Full-syntax crossreferences

The above doesn't seem to work, so we could try the full syntax.

****
We can link to xref:links[this section].

We can also link this way: xref:links[].

We can link to the section on xref:Table{sp}test[tables] (or xref:Table{sp}test[]).  The same for xref:blocks[blocks] (or xref:blocks[]).

Finally, to xref:paragraphs[paragraphs (no custom id)] or xref:paragraphs[].
